## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

-Reinforced the use of height instead of padding when trying to copy designs.
-I learned how to manipulate the background css propert more effectively.
 --Applying multiple background images, and styling them with size and position
-I saw a cool idea to style the contribution by creating a hover effect, didn't apply it in the design though it just opened up my mind a bit.




### Continued development

I like to understand the proper use of padding and margin. When and how to use them.
